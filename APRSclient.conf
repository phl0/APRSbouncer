# APRSclient Config
###

Callsign = N0CALL
# Set your Callsign as it should appear on the map. Callsign for APRS Server
# login should probably be different (e.g. SSID "-1") as some servers drop
# concurrent connections with same login.

Server   = euro.aprs2.net
# Set the hostname of the APRS-IS Server. E.g. euro.aprs2.net. See 
# http://www.aprs2.net/

Port     = 14580
# Set the Port to connect to. It will most likely be 14580 as standard port with
# user defined filters that we need in this case.

Username = N0CALL-1
# This is the username that is used for the login to the APRS-IS server. If you
# want to use this program in parallel with some APRS client (e.g. Xastir) you
# will probably want to use some different SSID here as some servers drop
# concurrent connections with the same login.

Passcode = 12345
# Set the APRS-IS passcode here. This something like a unique password for your
# login to the APRS-IS system. The passcode can be calculated via:
