# APRSbouncer
A console based client for APRS-IS written in Perl. The purpose is to have "deputy" APRS client on the APRS-IS as long as your default (HF-)APRS station is offline.

# Requirements
The script needs two Perl modules that can be installed from the default repositories. Under Ubuntu you need to install the packages libconfig-simple-perl and libnet-telnet-perl.

# Installation
There is no installation or compilation necessary. As long as you installed the aforementioned packages everything should work out of the box.
